<h1><center>Biography</center></h1>
<p>My name is John Philip C. LAngamin and I am currently studying at Cebu Technological University, Naga Extension Campus taking up Bachelor of Science  Information and Communication Technology. I am majoring in Programming.. I am the first person to
go to college and have really loved my experience at CTU-NAga! I come from a large family and am
the oldest of three children. Although I am far from
home, I feel I made a good choice attending CTU-Naga CAmpus because I've learned how to be independent and have
more confidence in learning new things on my own.</p>
